To solve the problem of determining the number of jumps a knight would take to reach each square of a chessboard from a given starting position using recursion, we need to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Although recursion is not the most natural fit for BFS, we'll use a queue to keep track of the knight's moves in a level-order fashion.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

    Initialize the Board and Variables:
        Create an 8x8 board to store the number of jumps required to reach each square.
        Initialize a queue to process each position on the board, starting with the knight's initial position.
        Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid processing the same square multiple times.

    Breadth-First Search (BFS):
        Start with the initial position of the knight and mark it with 0 jumps.
        For each position, calculate all possible knight moves.
        For each valid move, if the square hasn't been visited, update the number of jumps and enqueue the position.

    Print the Board:
        Output the board showing the number of jumps for each square.

        Explanation:

    BFS Function:
        Initializes the queue with the starting position and a jump count of 0.
        For each position, computes all possible moves of the knight.
        Checks if the new position is within bounds and has not been visited. If so, updates the board and enqueues the new position with an incremented jump count.

    IsValidPosition Function:
        Checks if a position is within the bounds of the chessboard.

    PrintBoard Function:
        Outputs the chessboard where each square shows the number of jumps required to reach it. Unreachable squares are marked with -.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of jumps required for a knight to reach each position on the board from a given starting position using a BFS approach.
